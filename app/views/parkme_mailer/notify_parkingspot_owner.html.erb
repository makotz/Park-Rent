Hello <%= @owner.first_name %>,

This is Makoto from Parkme.ca.
Today, I wanted to let you know that <%= @event.user.first_name %> is having a <%= @event.title %> near your <%= @parkingspot.title %>.
The <%= @event.title %> is from <%= @event.starttime %> until <%= @event.endtime %> and <%= @event.user.first_name %> is requesting
$<%= @event.suggested_price %> per hour.

If you would like to rent out your <%= @parkingspot.title %>, Click <%= link_to "here", new_session_url %> to sign in and add the spot on the <%= link_to "#{@event.title}", event_url(@event) %> event page.

Thank you for using ParkMe,

ParkMe Team
